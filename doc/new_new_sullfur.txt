VARS: array of objects

BLT_END : int

Â²
builtin vars starts at 0 and ends at BLT_END - 1
user variable starts at BLT_END

when an instruction push_var (val) has the most  left bit of val set to 1
the interpreter will replace the 1 by a 0 and add BLT_END for the offset
it is only at runtime so the file will not be modified


PARSER OF SUFRAMCE:
	INST : push 'var'
	if var correspond to a builtin name of var it will be its index
	else it will choose the first index that it find and set the left bit to 1

	this will also be done on push_col and push_dot
	on them BLT_END can be equal to 0 or be different than the global BLT_END
