OPERATORS:
	operators can be writen as an identifier or with special character equivalent if it has any

	   letter_name		 args						

	push 			|	(INT / FLOAT / BOOL / IDENTIFIER / STRING / LABEL / CONST_CALL)	|	push a value on the stack 
																						|	if arg is IDENTIFIER push is as string  and do push_var
																						|	if arg is LABEL push the address of the LABEL 
																						| 	if arg is CONST_CALL puhs the value of the constant on the stack
 	func_def		|	(STRING)  (IDENTIFIER)											|	arg0 : '+' (func with packed arg) / 'o'(func with only the nbr of arg):
																						|   arg1 : name of the function (only used by the compiler to find the end)
	end_func_def	|	(IDENTIFIER)													|	arg0 : name of the function (used by the func_def)
	jmp				|	(LABEL)															|	jump to the label unconditionaly
	jmp_if			|	(LABEL)															|	jump to the label if the top of the stack is true
	jmp_ifn			|	(LABEL)															|	jump to label if the top of stack is false(empty stack is false) 
	define 			| 	(IDENTIFIER) (INT / FLOAT / BOOL / STRING)						| 	define a constant to be used by the operator push



INT : 0x12 / 23 0b0011101
FLOAT : 3.14
BOOL : 0b / 1b
STRING : "hello" / 'bonjour'
OPERATORS : see operators
IDENTIFIER : cannot start with 0-9 cannot contains characters such as / * $ . ...
				and cannot be same as an operator  ex: a_var
CONST_CALL : !identifier (used by push)  ex : !PI
LABEL : identifier:: (used by jmps to jump to) ex: loop::
